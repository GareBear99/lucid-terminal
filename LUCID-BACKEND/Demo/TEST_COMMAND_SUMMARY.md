# Test Command Enhancements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the LLM test commands to properly detect installed models, show their locations, and prompt for installation when models are missing.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced `test all` Command**
- **Before**: Only checked `self.available_models` list
- **After**: 
  - Scans both main (`~/.luciferai/models/`) and backup directories
  - Shows which models are detected and their locations (main/backup)
  - Displays backup directory status if not configured
  - Suggests `install core models` command if no models found

### 2. **Enhanced `test <model>` Command**
- **Before**: Simple error message if model not installed
- **After**:
  - Checks both main and backup model directories
  - Shows specific search locations checked
  - Displays backup directory status with setup command hint
  - **Prompts user to install** with y/n confirmation
  - Routes to install command if user confirms

### 3. **Model Detection Logic**
Both commands now:
- Load backup directory from `config.json` if configured
- Check for model files in main directory first
- Check backup directory if configured
- Report exact locations searched
- Show helpful guidance if backup not set up

## Usage Examples

### Test All Models
```bash
test all
```

**Output when no models installed:**
```

❌ No models detected

Searched locations:
  • Main: /Users/username/.luciferai/models
  • Backup: Not configured
    (Set with: backup models)

No models to test. Install with: install core models
```

**Output when models are installed:**

### Test Specific Model
```bash
test tinyllama
```

**Output when not installed:**
```
❌ TINYLLAMA not detected

Searched locations:
  • Main: /Users/username/.luciferai/models
  • Backup: Not configured
    (Set with: backup models)

Would you like to install tinyllama? (y/n):

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Clear feedback on what was checked
   - Helpful suggestions for next steps
   - One-click installation prompts

2. **Backup Directory Awareness**
   - Tests work with models in backup locations
   - Reminds users to set up backup if not configured
   - Shows exact command to configure backup

3. **Intelligent Installation Flow**
   - No need to remember install commands
   - Direct route from test to install
   - Graceful cancellation support

## Test Coverage

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd Demo
python3 test_model_detection.py
```

Tests verify:
- ✅ Model detection in main directory
- ✅ Model detection in backup directory
- ✅ Backup directory configuration display
- ✅ Installation prompt behavior
- ✅ "test all" output formatting
- ✅ Specific model test output
